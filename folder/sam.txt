Coconut Caterpillar Infestation

Coconut caterpillar infestation refers to the attack of coconut palms by caterpillars, most commonly the larvae of the coconut leaf-eating caterpillar (Opisina arenosella). These pests feed on the leaves of coconut trees, causing defoliation, reduced photosynthesis, and ultimately lower coconut yields.

Signs of Infestation:
- Presence of caterpillars and silken webs on coconut fronds
- Skeletonized leaves with only veins remaining
- Frass (caterpillar droppings) on leaves and ground

Management Strategies:
1. Mechanical: Remove and destroy infested leaves and caterpillars.
2. Biological: Encourage natural predators like parasitoid wasps and birds.
3. Chemical: Apply recommended insecticides as a last resort, following safety guidelines.
4. Cultural: Maintain field hygiene and monitor regularly for early detection.

Early intervention is key to preventing severe damage to coconut plantations.
